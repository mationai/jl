### Idea

In trying to create an app where uses can create simulations of 
origami folds (more on this on a future post), we need a way to
be able to write English-like commands yet at the same time be
properly structured. After looking for such a specification and
not able to find anything even close to it, I set out to create
one.

### Goals

The goal isn't to create a specification language that is just
for origami folding. For that, it will just be a custom taylored
specification with origami folding keywords. The goal is to create
a specification simple yet powerful and flexible engough to be
the standard for its intended use case which is command-like
specifications and configurations.

Core Features includes:

* Human readable commands specification
* Markdown sections for documentation
* Non-ambiguous type for values

### Example

```rust
  steps: [
    move a;
    move [1,2] [3 -4]; // comma optional in an array/list
    turn { x:1, y:2 };
    turn { x:1  y:2 }; // comma optional in an object/map
    do [
      fold points:[3] 90 over-edges:[16];
      unfold points:[0] 90 over-edges:[18];
    ];
  ]
```
(Near perfect syntax highlighting by setting the language to `rust`)

Translates to:
```js
{
  steps: [
    move: 'a',
    move: [[1, 2], [3, -4]],
    turn: {x:1, y:2 },
    turn: {x:1, y:2 },
    do: [
      ['fold', { points: [3] }, 90, { 'over-edges': [16] }],
      ['unfold', { points: [0] }, 90, { 'over-edges': [18] }],
    ],
  ]
}
```

Have a usecase for it? Love to hear what you think.
