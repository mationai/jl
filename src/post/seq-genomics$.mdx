title: Genome Sequencing wih Seq

Solutions for [Coursera Bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)
/ Stepik Genome Sequencing course with [Seq](https://seq-lang.org/)

## Motivation

I've always wanted to learn Bioinformatics / Genome Sequencing.
Seq-lang's [debut](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22107510)
last week is the prefect catalyst for starting. 

Seq seems like the perfect tool since it was created specifically
for the job. The downside is that it is too young, so many features
and "batteries" you expect from python, the language it is based on,
are missing. In addition, the following some of the things I felt 
missing working on the problem set: 

- functools
- better parse errors
- splat / unpack
- defaultdict

That being said, its speed, statical typing, pipeline operator `|>`, 
and similarities with python have made me overlook its early drawbacks easily.
