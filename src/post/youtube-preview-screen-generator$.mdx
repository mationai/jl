title: Youtube Video Preview Image Generator
---

Currently, to embed a video such as youtube video on a webpage, you need to include the iframe into the html. This is a problem in markdown parsers as iframes are not allowed.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804820/embed-a-youtube-video) has a nice solution around it. Instead of inserting the iframe, insert a video preview image to indicate to user it is a video. The image will however be a link to the youtube site instead of embedded in the page. It is a nice hack. 

However, to make the preview image look like a video, you need to capture a screen shot of the video. There should be an easier alternative. After not having much luck finding such tool, I decide to make one.

#### Requirements
`cv2`, `PIL`, `numpy`

#### Usage
``` 
gen_youtube_preview.py <image> [image-out-width=720]
 -OR-
gen_youtube_preview.py <video> <frame #> [image-out-width=720]
Eg.
gen_youtube_preview.py path/to/video.mp4 1
```

or for generic (non-youtube) play triangle icon:

``` 
gen_preview.py <image> [image-out-width=720]
 -OR-
gen_preview.py <video> <frame #> [image-out-width=720]
Eg.
gen_preview.py path/to/video.mp4 1
```

This will generate a video preview image and also print out the markdown linking syntax.

Generic (non-youtube) video preview

Youtube video preview

I bet you wanted to click that, didn't you? ;-)

All video previews in my github READMEs are generated using this tool.
