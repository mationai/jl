  description : "Welcome to the beginner course on JavaScript (also commonly known as JS). In this course, you will learn how to code in JS, a flexible yet powerful programming language that is used all over the web. Some of the most popular Internet companies like Facebook and Twitter extensively use JS to add functionality to and enhance their websites.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThis course is designed for people who have no prior programming knowledge.  In this course, you will learn about fundamental programming concepts through JS.  Throughout the course, you will write code to apply what you’ve learned to solve programming problems.<br><br><action>The goal of this mini-course is to see if you like our new learning approach.  You do not need to complete this course.  You can skip ahead by clicking on lessons and exercises on the left.</action>  Feel free to experiment with the exercises.  Don\'t worry about making mistakes. <action> If your solution is incorrect, simply retry by typing your new solution over the old one and press Enter.</action>  Ready? Let\'s get started!",

        Prompt: ' Let\'s get coding! <action>Type in <code>2 + 3</code> below and press Enter to see what happens.</action> ',
        Hint: [' Click on the code box (the blue highlighted box above) to enter code.', 'Type <code>2 + 3</code> in the code box above and press Enter to see the result.'],
        Solution: '5',
        Summary: ' You\'re off to a good start! The JS console read your instruction, evaluated it, and displayed ("printed") the result. This process is called evaluation of code. The code you wrote (<code>2 + 3</code>) is called an expression, and the evaluation of an expression (e.g. <code>2 + 3</code>) in JS always returns a value (e.g. <code>5</code>). ',

      2: {
        Prompt: ' Let\'s try using another common element of JS: strings. A string is just a sequence of symbols or characters, like a word or a sentence. Let’s use the name of my favorite language -- JavaScript! <action>Try typing in the word JavaScript between two double quotes, like this: <code>"JavaScript"</code> and press Enter.</action> Make sure to capitalize both the J and the S!',
        Hint: [' Make sure you surround the word with two double quotes, like this: <code>"JavaScript"</code>. ', ' Remember that strings are case-sensitive, so make sure to capitalize the J and the S in JavaScript. ', ' Type <code>"JavaScript"</code> and press Enter. '],
        Solution: '"JavaScript"',

        Prompt: ' In JS, you can combine both strings and numbers by using the <code>+</code> operator. <action> Try typing <code>"It is currently the year " + 2013;</code> and press Enter.</action> ',
        Hint: [' Make sure that you have the double quotes only around the string. ', ' Be sure to type the text exactly as shown, and make sure to capitalize the \'I\' in \'It\'. ', ' Type <code>"It is currently the year " + 2013;</code>, and don\'t forget the space after <code>year</code>. Include the semicolon for good style (though your code will still work without it). '],
        Solution: '"It is currently the year " + 2013;',
