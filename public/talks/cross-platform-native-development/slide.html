# Tidekit
- The only app development platform that lets you develop HTML5, hybrid and native apps for iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and the Web
— all from a single source of code written in JavaScript. 
- Bindings for different languages including Python, C, C++, Java, C#, Objective-C
- Beta Testing via paid waiting list of $29 or priority seating for $99

# Vaporware
- After more than a year with nothing to show, it announced:
<blockquote><i>We failed to bring the product quickly enough for you. As a result, we came to the serious decision to discontinue TideKit and dissolve our company.</i></blockquote>
- lawsuits were filed for 1000+ paid supporters

# Native Mobile Development Environments
---
# iOS
- operating system for iphone, ipad, ipod touch, appleTV
- uses XNU kernel, the kernel for Darwin, a Unix OS which began in form of NeXT’s OS and became the base for OS X
- iOS SDK stack (hierarchically):
.md[
1. Cocoa Touch Platform
2. Media / Application Services
3. Core Services
4. Core OS / iOS kernel
]
---
# Cocoa Touch

---
# Cocoa Touch key frameworks
- Foundation Kit Framework
- UIKit Framework (based on Application Kit)
- GameKit Framework
- iAd Framework
- MapKit Framework

- EventKit UI Framework
- Message UI Framework
- Notification Center Framework
- PushKit Framework
- Twitter Framework
---
# Native iOS Languages
- c, c++, objective-C, swift
- most documentations are still for objective-C
- “Objective-C - a hacked language to incorporate smalltalk on top of c”

Swift:
- characterized as “Objective-C without the C”
- 2.0 announced and open sourced June’15
- usage is growing
- will probably replace Objective-C as the de facto language for iOS and MacOS apps
---
# Android OS
- operating system for Android phones, tablets, and PC, Android TV, Android Wear, and Android Auto
- started life as OS for the Danger smartphone
- uses version 3.4 or 3.10 of Linux kernel
---

- on version 5.0 (Lollipop) and later
- uses of ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation by compiling entire applications into native machine code upon their installation.
---
# Android SDK
SDK:
- debugger, libraries, and emulator

Native Languages support:
- Java (any JVM languages), Go
- other languages can be compiled to ARM and MIPS, and be installed via the Android NDK (Native Development Kit)
---
# Official Tools
XCode(iOS):

# React Native
- “Bringing modern web techniques to mobile“
- true native UI (only on iOS for now)
- based on componentkit, a native port of React to iOS also by facebook
- aims to primarily bring the power of the React programming model to mobile app development
- aims to be a learn-once write-anywhere tool
- not aim to be a write-once run-anywhere cross platform tool
- only environment with virtual DOM and reconciliation, bringing functional programming to the UI layer
---
# React Native vs. React
- Instead of using block elements such as div or section, use the View component, which maps over to the native iOS component UIView
- All text must be wrapped inside the Text component
- No stylesheets - all your styling is written as JavaScript objects
- ES6 is supported out of the box as well as flexbox
