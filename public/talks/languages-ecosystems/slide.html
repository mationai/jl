# C
- developed by Dennis Ritchie 1969 - 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs
- general-purpose, imperative, statically typed
- constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions
- *"The new assembly"*
- typical applications: OS, embedded systems
- Influenced by: 
.md[
* Fortran (John Backus, 1957)
* ALGOL (Committe of 8, including John Backus, '58, '60, '68)
* PL/1 (IBM, *SHARE* Committee, 1964)
* B (Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, 1969)
]

# C Standards
- K&R C, 1978
  - Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published *The C Programming Language* in 1978
  - the book served for many years as an informal specification of C, aka *K&R C*
  - large number of extensions
- ANSI C, 1983
  - large number of extensions led to the necessity of standardization
  - the *American National Standards Institue* (ANSI) formed a committee in 1983 to standardize C 
  - ANSI C standard adopted by ISO in 1990
---
# C Standards
- C99, 1999 - added:
.md[
* inline functions 
* `long long int` and `complex` data types
* variable length array, flexible array members
* better floating point support
* macros of variable arity
* `// single line comments`
]
- C11, 2011 - added:
.md[
* type generic macros
* anonymous structures
* better Unicode support
* atomic operations
* multi-threading
* bounds-checked functions
* better C++ compatibility

# Erlang
- developed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams in 1986 
- general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language and runtime system
- dynamically typed, automatic memory management
- originally a proprietary language within Ericsson (*"Er"*), open sourced in 1998
- designed to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time, highly available, non-stop applications 
- supports _hot swapping_ (code can be changed without stopping the system)
- active, 18.0, 18.1 released in June, Sep 2015 
---
# Erlang Processes
- main strength in concurrency via light weight processes
- Erlang processes are not OS processes nor OS threads
- like OS processes, Erlang processes share no state
- processes communicate via share-nothing message passing, removing need for explicit locks
- processes are very light weight, only 300 words overhead
- millions of processes can be created without much degrade in performance
---
# Erlang - language for fault tolerant distributed systems 
- in GPRS, 3G, LTE mobile networks worldwide
- Yaws - web server
- Riak, CouchDB, SimpleDB - distributed databases
- ejabberd - XMPP server powering Facebook Chat
- Chef - configuration management tool re-written from Ruby
- RabbitMQ - Message Queuing Protocol implementation
- RPC proxies to ruby processes for GitHub
- WhatsApp, Goldman Sachs HFT programs 
- Call of Duty, League of Legends, Battlestar Online game servers

- dynamically typed, automatic memory management 
- *"The new BASIC"*
- *"Batteries Included"*
- active, 3.5 released in Sep 2015 
- langauge proposals via PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)
---
# PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated
- Readability counts
---
# Python Implementations
- CPython - official implementation, written in C 
- PyPy - much faster JIT runtime
- Jython, IronPython - JVM, .NET runtimes
- Cython - python-like language with cdef type declarations, compiles to C++
- Numba - JIT LLVM compiler via declarator signatures
---
# Python - language for Science and Machine Learning
- NumPy - matrix library that uses BLAS, allowing matrix calculations to be close to speed other languages using BLAS, even closer if used in PyPy 
- SciPy, scikit-learn, BioPython, Sage, iPython notebook, Pandas
- many deep neural network libraries
- best supported language for OpenCV
- NLTK
- "machine learning" in github: 3337 in python, 2264 in Matlab, 1050 in R, 1006 in Java, 496 in C++

# Lua
- created by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique, Waldemar Celes in 1993
- designed to be a general purpose scripting language with embeddability and extensibilty as primary goals
- lightest weight (180kB for full reference interpreter) scripting language
- first-class functions, GC, closures, proper tail calls, coroutines
- ~50% - 3x faster than python in general benchmarks
- dynamically typed, 
- single data structure: table
- simple C API
---
# Lua - language for Games, UI, and Embedded Systems
- Mods, including Minecraft, Half-Life 2, many others
- World of Warcraft UI subsystem
- Game Engine for Corona, Moai, and many others 
- full or large portion of many games
- over 40% of Adobe Lightroom is written in Lua
- eLua - embedded software applications builder
- OpenResty - web server bundling Nginx core

# Ruby
- created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (松本行弘) "Matz", released in 1995
- general purpose, object oriented, dynamically typed scripting language
- Why? "Didn't like Perl because it smells like a toy language. Didn't like Python because it's not a true object oriented language. I wanted a genuine object oriented, easy to use scripting language" - Matz 1999
- everything is a true object

# Javascript
- developed in 10 days by Brendan Eich in May 1995
- originally called LiveScript, renamed to JavaScript when shipped in Netscape 2.0 in Sep 1995
- designed to be a lightweight interpreted language used in a browser
- part of to the ECMA standard in June 1997, but no official "governing" body, hence no official logo
- fun fact - *JavaScript* is a trademark of Oracle
- predicted by Steve Yegge in 2007 to be *"The Next Big Langauge"* (web2.0 just coined 1+ years ago and ajax just a year ago)
- cemented its dominance with introduction of ajax (2005), jQuery (2006), node.js (2009)
---
# Javascript - language for web and mobile
- *"The new C"*, *"The web assembly"*
- now a *"platform"* - languages that compiles to javascript: over 100
- a real platform - WebAssembly (supersedes asm.js) - ports C code without modifications with less than 50% performance hit
- web worker - spawn workers that unblocks the UI thread 
- server application and server with node.js 
- native mobile applications with Titanium and React native
- non-native mobile applications with phonegap and many other frameworks
